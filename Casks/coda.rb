# This is `cask.rb.in`: `server/release.sh` fills in the version, the url and the sha256 and
# writes the result to `server/dist/coda.rb`, which is what goes into `Casks/coda.rb` in the
# tap. It is templated *here*, beside the app, for the same reason `install.sh.in` is: the
# caveats and the `zap` list describe what this app does to the machine, and they have to
# change in the commit that changes it, not in another repository afterwards.
#
# A cask rather than a formula because this is an app bundle. `Formula/coda-server.rb` stays
# where it is and ships the CLI — the two are the same daemon, and a machine may want either.
#
# The stanza order below is Homebrew's, not a preference: `brew style`'s Cask/StanzaOrder cop
# rejects any other, and `livecheck` in particular belongs above `depends_on`.

    <<~EOS
      This build is signed ad-hoc, not with a Developer ID, and Gatekeeper refuses an ad-hoc
      bundle that carries the quarantine flag — as "damaged", which it is not. Homebrew does
      not set that flag any more (`--no-quarantine` went with Homebrew 7, which stopped
      quarantining what it installs), so the copy it just put in /Applications opens as it
      is. A disk image downloaded in a browser is a different story — the browser sets the
      flag — and there it has to come off by hand.

        xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/coda.app

      Then open it. It lives in the menu bar and has no Dock icon; use **Pairing code…** in
      its menu and scan that with coda on your phone.

      It serves udp/51820 and attaches to the Herdr and Orca sessions you already run — it
      never starts one of its own. Its state, including the host key, is in ~/.coda.

      **Install agent hooks…**, also in its menu, is what makes the phone learn that an agent
      is waiting rather than finding out on the next poll. It shows you the change to
      ~/.claude/settings.json before writing it, and the command it writes lives inside this
      app — so moving or removing coda means installing them again.

      You do not also need `coda-server`: this app carries it. That formula is for a machine
      with no graphical session, where a status item cannot run. Do not run both — one port,
      and a listener that would share it rather than refuse it. The app looks before it binds
      and will tell you whose port it is, with an offer to take it over.
